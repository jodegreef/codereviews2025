# Assignment
Every project in the solution represents a separate exercise.

In pairs: take the first project, read the README, check the code and formulate feedback on the code.

We will discuss your findings with the whole group and then move on to the next project and so on.

For the purpose of this exercise, you may ignore the absence of test code.
